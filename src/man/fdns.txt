.SH DESCRIPTION
FDNS is a DNS-over-HTTPS proxy server targeted at small networks and Linux desktops.
To speed up the name resolution the proxy caches the responses, and uses a configurable
adblocker and privacy filter to cut down the unnecessary traffic.

We preconfigure FDNS with a large list of DoH service providers. For privacy reasons we
use only DoH services from non-logging providers. We prefer servers run out-of-pocket by
students, engineers, open-source enthusiasts, privacy-oriented non-profit organizations, etc.
Currently there are more than 60 such DoH servers on our list.

We also track a corporate category with four providers: Adguard, CleanBrowsing, Cloudflare,
and Quad9. All have a non-logging privacy policy that will work in most parts of the world.

The servers are organized using a simple geographically-aware tagging system. This allows the
user to request specialized services such as adblocking, security, family filters, etc.

Once started, FDNS chooses a server at random, as close geographically as possible.
We derive the computer location from the timezone setting. There are no IP packets sent
out to geolocation services. Four zones are defined so far: Americas-East, Americas-West,
Asia-Pacific and Europe. Use --list=all option to print all the servers and the corresponding tags.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-\-allow-all-queries
Allow all DNS query types; by default only A queries are allowed. In case --ipv6 is set,
AAAA queries are also allowed.
.TP
\fB\-\-allow-local-doh
Allow applications on local network to connect to DoH services; disabled by default.
NOTE: Applications can still use DoH-Server if they have a hardcoded IP-Address.
If you realy want to block other DoH connection you must use your firewall.
.TP
\fB\-\-cache-ttl=seconds
Change DNS cache TTL, in seconds. By default we use a fixed cache TTL of 900 seconds (15 minutes).
.TP
\fB\-\-certfile=filename
Use an SSL certificate file in PEM format. By default we use the certificates installed
by OpenSSL.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
$ sudo fdns --certfile=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
.TP
\fB\-\-daemonize
Detach from the controlling terminal and run as a Unix daemon. The typical way to start
FDNS as network proxy is
.br

.br
$ sudo fdns --proxy-addr-any --daemonize
.br
.TP
\fB\-\-debug
Print debug messages.
.TP
\fB\-\-forwarder=domain@address
Conditional domain forwarding to a different DNS server.
.br

.br
Example:
.br
$ sudo fdns --forwarder=libre@66.70.228.164
.br

.br
The proxy will forward all .libre domains to OpenNIC server at 66.70.228.164.

.TP
\fB\-\-help, \-?, \-h
Print command-line options and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-ipv6
Allow AAAA requests. Use this option if you have Internet IPv6 connectivity. By default IPv6 queries are disabled.
.TP
\fB\-\-list

.br

.br
$ fdns --list
.br
Current zone: Europe
.br
42l - non-profit, France, Europe

.SH Setup FDNS on a workstation
You would need to set FDNS as your DNS server in /etc/resolv.conf:
.br

.br
.PP
.RS
$ cat /etc/resolv.conf
.br
nameserver 127.1.1.1
.br

.br
.RE
You can also use Firejail security sandbox to redirect all the DNS traffic to 127.1.1.1,
where FDNS listens by default. Firejail decouples the DNS functionality, allowing each
sandbox to have its own DNS setting. Your system DNS configuration is not touched.
If things go wrong, you won't lose your Internet connectivity. Here are the steps:



.TP
\fBStart FDNS:
$ sudo fdns
.TP
\fBStart your applications in Firejail:
$ firejail --dns=127.1.1.1 firefox
.br
$ firejail --dns=127.1.1.1 transmission-qt
.br
.br
.SH Setup FDNS as a network server
Install FDNS and set "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/resolv.conf. Start fdns using --proxy-addr-any. The proxy will listen on all system interfaces, and 127.0.0.1 for loopback interface. The default 127.1.1.1 is not used in this case.
.PP
.RS
$ sudo fdns --proxy-addr-any --daemonize
.br

.br
.RE
Or you can run it only on a specific interface. Example assuming 192.168.1.44 is the IP address of eth0:
.PP
.RS
$ sudo fdns --proxy-addr=192.168.1.44 --daemonize
.br

.br
.RE
When using --daemonize, errors and warnings are posted to syslog.

.SH FAQ

.TP
\fBHow do I start fdns when I power-on the computer?
One solution that will work on any Linux computer is to start it from /etc/rc.local.
.br

.br
$ cat /etc/rc.local
.br
#!/bin/sh -e
.br
/usr/bin/fdns --daemonize
.br
exit 0
.br

.br
For systemd users, we place a fdns.service file in /etc/fdns directory.

.TP
\fBHow do I configure Firejail to send all the DNS traffic to fdns by default?
As root user, add the following two lines in /etc/firejail/golbals.local. If the file doesn't exist, create it:
.br

.br
$ cat /etc/firejail/globals.local
.br
dns 127.1.1.1
.br
ignore dns
.br

.TP
\fBHow do I save a list with all the DNS requests?
Start fdns this way:
.br

.br
$ sudo fdns | tee dnslist.txt
.br

.TP
\fBHow do I check fdns is running in the background?
Run ss and look for sockets open on port 53:
.br

.br
$ sudo ss -nulp
.br
State     Recv-Q    Send-Q       Local Address:Port        Peer Address:Port
.br
UNCONN    0         0                127.1.1.1:53               0.0.0.0:*        users:(("fdns",pid=4227,fd=11))
.br
UNCONN    0         0                127.1.1.1:53               0.0.0.0:*        users:(("fdns",pid=4226,fd=9))
.br
UNCONN    0         0                127.1.1.1:53               0.0.0.0:*        users:(("fdns",pid=4225,fd=7))
.br


.TP
\fBHow do I shut down fdns?
$ sudo pkill fdns
