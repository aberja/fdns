What is fdns?
-----------
fdns is a DNS-over-HTTPS proxy server targeted at small networks and
Linux desktops. To speed up the name resolution fdns caches the responses,
and uses a configurable adblocker and privacy filter to cut down the
unnecessary traffic.

The software is written in C, and is licensed under GPLv3.
