#
# User blocklist file loaded by default by fdns at startup.
# This file is not overwritten at install time.
#
# Example:
#	127.0.0.1 domain-name.com
#
# These are wildcard domains, like *.domain-name.com in the example above.
# Any site under domain-name.com will be dropped.
#
# Note:
#    glibc library installed on Linux does not support wildcard domains.
#    Copying /etc/hosts in /etc/fdns/hosts will work, but not the other
#    way around.
