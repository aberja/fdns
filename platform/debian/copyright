This is the Debian/Ubuntu prepackaged version of fdns.

    fdns is a DNS-over-HTTPS proxy server targeted at small networks and
    Linux desktops. To speed up the name resolution fdns caches the responses,
    and uses a configurable adblocker and privacy filter to cut down the
    unnecessary traffic. The software is written in C, and is licensed under GPLv3.
